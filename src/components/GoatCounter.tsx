// GoatCounter analytics — cookieless, no personal data (matches the site's
// privacy story). bbstats.goatcounter.com is the site code created for
// backbencher.cc in the project GoatCounter account.
//
// Counting contract (no double counts, no lost navigations):
//   - The count.js script auto-counts the INITIAL pageview when it loads.
//   - This component counts only SUBSEQUENT client-side navigations
//     (Next.js App Router doesn't reload the page, so the script alone
//     would miss every route change after the first).
//   - If the script hasn't loaded yet when a navigation happens (slow
//     network, or an adblocker that eventually gives up), the count is
//     retried a bounded number of times and then abandoned silently.
