Every read mode carries a freshness block (fresh/stale/missing counts + remediation) resolved against the live working tree, and report rows carry a stale flag when their file changed after indexing. Every mode is BOUNDED and says so: `limit` is the most items returned (edges per direction for callers/callees/trace, files for dependencies, entries for the test modes, the same everywhere) and the answer reports what it returned against what exists, so a page is never read as the whole set. callers/callees/trace/impact share the graph engine's owner-cascade semantics — a relationship stored against a class member is attributed to the owner class — and every edge states which it was through `targetMatch`. WHICH symbol the name resolved to is declared as well: `rootMatch` is `exact`, `exact-any-kind` or `containment`, and `containment` means the answer is about a symbol whose name CONTAINS the one asked for, or differs only in case — `found: true` on its own does not mean the name was itself a symbol. Locations are project-relative. Per-mode parameters: target applies to callers, callees, trace, complexity, impact, and test_impact; filePath scopes dependencies, test_mapping, test_gaps, and test_quality to a project-relative path PREFIX and is REFUSED (not ignored) on every other mode; limit applies to callers, callees, trace, dependencies, test_mapping, test_gaps and test_quality and is refused elsewhere; stats is always project-wide.",

Every answer reports its confidence kind: a mean of returned similarities (bounded 0.2–0.85), a declared floor when no score was computed, or NO confidence number at all when the ranking is declared non-discriminative (the answer then says the scores do not separate candidates).

Every fact names both ends — the copy of the requested name it came from and the other symbol's name, file, language and line — plus the stored row id. A name is many symbols (the index holds one per file/name/line), so facts are the union over every copy; `copies` names them and `ambiguous` says so. SEPARATELY, `memberFacts` holds the rows on the copies' MEMBERS: each fact's `self` is the MEMBER the stored row names, `owner` is the copy of the asked name it was attributed through, and `pair` is exactly `self.language → other.language` (null when the two are equal or unknown, and then the row is counted in `unpairableRowCount` rather than given a pair). Member rows are the MEMBER's edges, never absorbed into the symbol's — `ownFactCount`, `memberFactCount` and `silentItselfButNotItsMembers` tell the two apart. Absence is a property of the store: it is declared only when neither the copies nor their direct members hold a stored row. A row that exists but cannot name a language pair is NOT absence — it is counted in `unpairableRowCount` and named in `pairlessRowNote`, while `storedRowCount` still reports it. Rows on descendants at depth 2 or deeper are counted in `deeperDescendantRowCount` (both directions) and deliberately not cascaded. Counts name what they count: `factCount` facts in this answer, `pairCount` DISTINCT language pairs, `signatureCount` distinct (pair, direction, bridge, tier); `memberCount` is the distinct members that contributed BEFORE the limit while `memberFactCount` is what was shown, and `ownFactsTruncated`/`memberFactsTruncated` say which section a limit cut.

The bytes each target had when the edit was PLANNED are re-checked immediately before the write, so a file that changed in between (an editor saving during a multi-file refactor, say) is refused with nothing written rather than overwritten from a plan computed against its previous contents. A project with no index is not a dead end: `write` plans from the request and the disk, resolves no symbol, and reindexes the file it wrote (so `reindexed` is how a brand-new project gets its first indexed rows), while `update`, `insert`, `delete` and `refactor` resolve their target through the index and are refused — with the mode that still works named beside the reindex command — until one exists. `write` replacing an existing file is guarded: a replacement that removes at least half of a file's lines (and at least 5 lines) is refused as a probable mistake unless `overwrite: true` is passed, and `overwrite: false` makes the write create-only — the refusal names the file, the line counts and both options. `batch` applies several edits, or one edit across several files, as ONE atomic call: every entry is planned before anything is written (so a refusal anywhere writes nothing), the bytes of EVERY target are re-checked together immediately before the first write, and formatting, validation and reindexing each run ONCE for the whole call. Two entries may not resolve to the same file — each is planned from its file's pre-edit bytes, so the second would discard the first, and that is refused by entry index. Every answer carries a per-file `envelope` (`planned`, `committed`, `restored`, and the pre/post byte counts), and a refused call carries the same envelope on the error, so \"is my working tree back?\" is answered per file rather than by one boolean.

Same engine and tier rules the editor graph panel uses; truncated traversals are declared with a reason, never silent. Traversal semantics: a relationship stored against any member of a class (a method call, an inherited behavior) is attributed to the owner class, so caller/callee sets include the owner-family level — every edge still traces to a stored relationship row and states whether it matched the symbol itself or one of its members. Each edge's `rowId` is the stored relationship key with its leading '<projectHash>:rel:' removed, and each endpoint's `id` is the stored symbol key with its leading '<projectHash>:' removed — both prefixes are constant within one answer, and `root.id` carries the FULL stored form, so '<projectHash>' is the segment before its first ':' and prepending it (plus ':rel:' for a rowId) reconstructs the store key exactly. An `ext:` id has no such prefix and is returned whole. The graph is READ from a read-only index handle: asking a question cannot mutate the index. Measured on this repository's reference index (11,440 files, 310,423 symbols, 820,040 stored relationships), a default call answers in 22-355 ms p95 depending on the symbol's degree, where the same call took 131 s before the engine's cascade and arm queries were rewritten to seek their indexes.",

There is no `mode` parameter: a call reports status, and `refresh`/`force` select the one behaviour that mutates the index. The default output names WHY each file was classified: `freshness why` separates fresh-verified-by-content-hash from fresh-verified-by-mtime+size-only (the file was not read), and names content-changed, deleted-from-disk, unreadable and unindexed separately, because those need different fixes and a single 'N stale' number is not actionable. Every report carries a top-level `healthy` boolean on the tool result (and inside the JSON payload when history=true): false exactly when the report contains an error-severity finding; a broken index is a successful REPORT, not a tool error (isError stays false), while wrong input is refused with isError. Options the chosen call cannot honour are refused: `limit` needs history=true; `wait` needs refresh/force; `sampleSize` belongs to sampled freshness only. Use verbose=true for a per-language breakdown, PER-LANGUAGE SEARCHABILITY (the share of each language's symbols a semantic query can reach — a language at 0% is invisible to bb_ask), the embedded/unembedded symbol kinds and stale-file names; verbose=true is also the only call that runs the per-symbol embedding aggregates, so a default call is bounded by the file count, not the symbol count. integrity=true runs the index integrity check battery, which NAMES each non-ok check with its remediation; with the default sampled freshness the battery falls back to a COMPLETE disk pass over the indexed files (it content-hashes files whose metadata changed), so it is materially more expensive than a status call. freshness=\"complete\" (not a `complete` option) checks every indexed file instead of a sample; includeAnalysisRuns=true adds persisted run/finding totals; history=true answers with a JSON object { health, history, healthy } instead of the text report and is the only caller of `limit` (minimum 1, default 20). checkUnindexed=true walks the project and reports files the indexer would index but the index does not contain — a stat per eligible file, opt-in because a default call must not silently acquire a walk. refresh=true reindexes before reporting (`wait` defaults true; wait=false detaches it and the NEXT call reports the outcome once, success or failure); force=true wipes and rebuilds first and is DESTRUCTIVE.

Stale rows carry `stale:true` and the freshness block's remediation names the manual reindex command (file scope names that exact file). `limit` is a page size and a work budget: 0 returns no rows, values above 2000 are refused rather than clamped, and `limit`/`offset` are accepted only by the modes that page (`symbols`, `content`). `language`/`symbolKind` values the index does not contain are errors naming the indexed vocabulary; options a mode cannot honour are refused naming that mode's accepted set; an invalid regex is a named error; a candidate cap, projection cap or time budget is reported as `truncated` with `truncationReason` instead of a complete-looking page.",

      "description": "Scoped dependency and architecture visualization: one bounded projection over the index's stored symbol and relationship rows, with explicit filters, provenance, truncation, machine-readable JSON, and genuinely self-contained HTML (no network, no fonts, no build step — it renders offline, in an air-gapped editor, anywhere). The answer is an AUDITABLE projection of the index, not a picture: every link carries the stored relationship row it traces to (rowId) and its stored confidence, and every node carries its line, lineEnd and qualifiedName, so the graph is navigable and every edge can be checked against the row that justifies it. Distinct relationship types between the same pair are SEPARATE links, so a pair that is both contains and exports renders as both. Node size follows the index’s own gravity score. In the HTML, edge opacity encodes stored confidence, relationship type sets colour and a structural/behavioural dash, a CROSS-LANGUAGE edge gets its own wide dash and is drawn beneath the local edges so a polyglot project shows where one language hands off to another, and a stale endpoint (file changed since index) is drawn as a hollow ring; links inherit worst-of-endpoints. Nodes are grouped into the NAMED REGION they live in — a directory of the project, a directory with fewer than three matching symbols folded into its parent — each region placed at its own anchor inside a rounded pod and switchable from the sidebar like any other class, At overview zoom an edge BETWEEN two regions is drawn as one REGION LINK per region pair — dotted, because it is a summary and not a stored row; its width and alpha come from how many stored edges it stands for — while an edge INSIDE one region is always drawn as itself, and the individual cross-region edges return past ~1.15x zoom or when a link is opened (double-click frames both of its regions). Edges drawn individually are capped at a zoom-dependent count with the readout naming the cap, because an uncapped aggregate is a smear rather than a map; the frame's readout reconciles the picture with the census (how many cross-region edges the links stand for, how many pairs exist, how to open them), the sidebar's live line repeats it, and the links — with their regions, counts, stored rows, commonest relationship and screen geometry — are PUBLISHED on the view's API rather than only painted, because a summary that can only be seen cannot be checked. Moving the pointer across the map never changes the view: hover emphasises the node's own edges, and a CLICK is what focuses, so the map cannot dissolve under the reader's hand. The graph has TWO arrangements and the reader picks: `layout: \"regions\"` (the default) is the region map described above, and `layout: \"force\"` drops the directories entirely — one force layout, no region pods and no region links, every stored edge drawn as itself under the same zoom-dependent cap — which is the graph as it looked before the regions existed, and which is the honest shape for a project whose parts do not fall along directory lines. The layout is written onto the document itself (data-bb-layout) and both arrangements are offered as a switch in the generated page's sidebar, so `layout` sets the arrangement the page OPENS with and the reader can move between them without regenerating anything. The picked-item panel is deliberately not a modal: it docks to either side of the frame and collapses to its own heading — which always names what is picked — while KEEPING the selection, because hiding a panel to see the picture must not cost the reader the focus and the zoom they just asked for (its X is the control that clears). The layout runs in frame-sized slices with a progress readout, so the artifact stays interactive and visible at the maximum graph size and in a background tab. Every answer declares its bounds as three DISTINCT numbers — totalNodesAvailable (what the scope and filters actually match), truncation.originalNodes (what reached the projection) and nodes (what was returned) — and the HTML artifact carries the same declaration in its machine-readable payload (`declared`), so a short page can never be mistaken for a whole set in any format. `offset` walks that same order rather than re-reading the first page: the ranking carries a final `s.id` tiebreaker so page k+1 begins exactly where page k ended, and `considered.page` declares which page the answer is, of how many, and where the next one starts (null on the last) — a scope larger than one page can be walked, and an offset past the end is stated as an empty PAGE rather than as an empty project. Whatever the noise filter removes is counted onto excluded with the patterns responsible — always present, including when it is empty, so silence and zero are never confused — and an empty answer is declaredAbsent with a reason rather than an empty result that looks like a real project. `considered` declares what the answer actually READ: the relationship rows connecting the returned nodes (complete for that node set, not a slice of the relationship table), the selection order that chose the nodes, the applied filters, and the symbol-kind and language census of what was returned, plus the annotation overlay and the owner-cascade counts. `considered.overlays` carries the index's OTHER facts about the returned symbols — agent annotations from `bb_annotate`, matched by NAME AND PATH (never by name alone: two symbols can share a name, and a note is about one of them), with the notes themselves, the author class, and a count of notes that name a symbol of this scope at another path and are therefore NOT attached. The layer is declared even when it is empty, so \"no agent has annotated these symbols\" and \"nobody looked\" are different replies. Language filters are applied BEFORE the limit, so a rare language receives the same budget as a common one. The DEFAULT text format carries the same declared coverage, selection and exclusion as the JSON one, so the reply a caller gets without asking is the reply that can be audited. Member-level relationships are FOLDED onto the owner class, and every folded edge says so: when a class-like symbol is selected and a relationship is stored on one of its MEMBERS that is not itself in the node set, the row is attributed to the owner and the edge carries ownerCascade with matchedMembers naming the member it came through — so an attributed edge is never presented as one the index stored between the two drawn nodes. The fold is deliberately narrow (one level, class-like owners only, never for contains, an exact edge always preferred to an attributed one) and `considered.ownerCascade` declares whether it ran, how many members it scanned, how many rows it folded and whether a cap truncated it, so \"nothing to fold\" and \"the fold never ran\" are distinguishable. This is NOT bb_graph's depth-N traversal: the edge set is the relationships between the selected nodes, plus the folded member rows.",
