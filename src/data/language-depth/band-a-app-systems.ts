// Band A — Application & systems (15 families).
//
// Every record below was written by reading the family's own analyzer in
// src/ast/ — the file name is `real-<lang>-analyzer.ts` — and, where one
// exists, its contract in docs/analyzers/. The claims are checked against the
// module's SymbolKind and RelationshipType sites, not against anything the
// website said about the language before.
//
// `limitations` is the most valuable field here. Each line names a specific
// construct the analyzer declines, filters or bounds, because that boundary is
// what a reader actually needs and no dataset can supply it.
//
// TWO RULES THAT CHANGED THE SHAPE OF EVERY RECORD BELOW:
//
// 1. A missing relationship type is a fact about the FORMAT, not about analyzer
//    quality. Go has no inheritance, so it has no `overrides`. Rust has no
//    overriding, so a trait impl is `implements`. Erlang has no inheritance at
//    all. Zig composes rather than inherits. C has no class heritage. Those
//    families are written as having what their format expresses, and the
//    absence is stated as the format fact it is. The opposite case is not
//    softened either: a language that HAS call syntax and whose analyzer does
//    not resolve it would be a real defect, and none is claimed here.
//
// 2. Every family here has a hand-written analyzer. `GenericAnalyzer` is the
//    unreachable `default:` branch of getAnalyzer and describes code that never
//    runs, so no record below may claim a family is missing one.
//
// (Where the word "tier" appears further down it means a CONFIDENCE tier inside
// an analyzer's override resolver — Java's and Swift's three-tier pass — which is
// the engine's own vocabulary. It is not the removed `LangFamily.tier` label.)
