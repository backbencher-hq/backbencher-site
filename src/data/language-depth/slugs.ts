// The slug contract — one URL per display family, authored once.
//
// WHY AN EXPLICIT MAP AND NOT A SLUGIFIER
// ---------------------------------------
// A mechanical slugifier collides. "C", "C++" and "C#" all reduce to "c";
// "HCL / Terraform" mechanically reduces to
// "hcl-terraform", which is nobody's idea of the name. A detail page whose
// address is wrong is a permanent wart, so the 45 URLs are written down here
// and every language surface reads them from this one map.
//
// Contract:
//   - one entry per family in brain-languages.ts PARSERS, keyed by that
//     family's exact display `name`;
//   - lowercase, hyphen-separated, no dots, no slashes, no `+`;
//   - stable forever: changing a slug breaks inbound links, so treat this map
//     as frozen once it lands;
//   - slug is NOT derived from `ids` — those are registry names and are
//     gate-pinned; the display name is what a human typed in a URL bar.
//
// The inverse map (`slugToFamily`) is what the dynamic route uses to resolve
// an incoming param, so a request for an unknown slug can 404 instead of
// rendering an empty page.
//
// This module deliberately imports NOTHING. The sitemap and three verification
// gates all need this list, and importing `../brain-languages` here would drag
// the icon library into a build-time sitemap and into repo-root scripts that
// resolves its imports the same way. Drift against the language dataset is
// caught by the import-time validation in ./index.ts, which does have the
// dataset; this file stays a pure declaration.
