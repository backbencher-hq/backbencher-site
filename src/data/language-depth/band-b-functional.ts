// Band B — Functional & declarative (9 families).
//
// Every record below was written by reading the family's own analyzer in
// src/ast/ — the file name is `real-<lang>-analyzer.ts` — and, where one
// exists, its contract in docs/analyzers/. The claims are checked against the
// module's SymbolKind and RelationshipType sites, not against anything the
// website said about the language before.
//
// `limitations` is the most valuable field here. Each line names a specific
// construct the analyzer declines, filters or bounds, because that boundary is
// what a reader actually needs and no dataset can supply it.
//
// TWO RULES THAT CHANGED THE SHAPE OF EVERY RECORD BELOW:
//
// 1. A missing relationship type is a fact about the FORMAT, not about analyzer
//    quality. Erlang has no inheritance. Haskell's instances are not method
//    overrides on a base type. Julia has multiple dispatch rather than
//    overriding, and its analyzer declines `overrides` for exactly that reason.
//    Those are written as what the format expresses, and the absence is stated
//    as the format fact it is. Elixir and Clojure do resolve calls — through a
//    Kernel filter and a core-name filter respectively, and both filters are
//    named below with their sizes.
//
// 2. Every family here has a hand-written analyzer. `GenericAnalyzer` is the
//    unreachable `default:` branch of getAnalyzer and describes code that never
//    runs, so no record below may claim a family is missing one.
//
// (Where the word "tier" appears further down it means a CONFIDENCE tier inside
// an analyzer's override resolver, which is the engine's own vocabulary. It is
// not the removed `LangFamily.tier` label.)
